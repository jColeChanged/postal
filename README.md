# What is Postal?

Not every chat service supports the sending of messages to users who are offline. Postal is a bot plugin designed to solve this problem. Though the core classes could be made to work with other C++ based chat bots, this implementation in particular is written as a module for the CamFrog Chatbot.

# How Can I try it?

You can build the project by entering ``make`` in the same directory as the makefile. If ``#define CONSOLEMAIL_APP`` has been defined in the source then this should result in a command line version of the application.

An alternative to this approach is using any bots which make use of the module on Camfrog or through other chat protocols or services.
