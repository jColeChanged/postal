# What is Postal?

Not every chat service supports the sending of messages to users who are offline. Postal is a bot plugin designed to solve this problem. Though the core classes could be made to work with other C++ based chat bots, the postal service in particular is written as a module for C++ based chat bots in general. However, over the course of testing I will be building out a command line client through which the messaging service can be interacted with.
